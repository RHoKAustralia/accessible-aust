<h1> About us </h1>
		<h2>What is TripClusive?</h2>

<p>TripClusive is an inclusive website that provides information for disabled tourists, support

people, government, businesses and NFP organisations.

</p><p>Our mission is to enable greater participation in tourism activities for people with disabilities. 
</p><p>
We started in 2016 to create a community and customisable experience for users, to help 

them find information in a pain free way and break down the barriers that prevent travel.
</p><p>
Our community looks out for one and other, providing feedback and reviews, ensuring that 

you feel comfortable that all tourism options available through our platform are verified by 

other users. The more you put into the platform, the more the community gets out of it, and 

the better your confidence is in your choices.
</p><p>
Our platform provides detailed filters to ensure you get only the most relevant options for 

your accessibility needs. We guarantee the most user friendly and painless experience to 

get the information you need.
</p>
<h2>Our people</h2>

<p>
Patrick and Tobias come from vastly different backgrounds, but together have passion and 

determination to make change in our communities, Australia and the world. We have a 

dream of creating a more inclusive and accessible world for everyone to enjoy, which drives 

our passion for TripClusive.</p>
